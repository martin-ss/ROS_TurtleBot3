# ROS_TurtleBot3

## Abstract

* Demonstration of tutlebot3 robot control and simulation is achieved through
  different completed tasks, which in order to be solved, a certain skills related
  to ROS basics in programming and architecture understanding should be
  mastered as , on top of that, Our simulated ROS
  environment provided by The-Construct website is exploited with the
  different provided ROS online courses as well as technical mentoring. As a
  result, our implementation been able to achieve the 4 requested tasks. In this
  report, a detailed guideline about the implementation will be presented in
  order for the reader to be able to implement it him/her self.

## Introduction

*TurtleBot3 is a one low-cost, personal robot with open-source software, that can
  perform different interesting goals. According to [1], TurtleBot3 is a small,
  affordable, programmable, ROS-based mobile robot for use in education, research,
  hobby, and product prototyping. The goal of TurtleBot3 is to dramatically reduce
  the size of the platform and lower the price without having to sacrifice its
  functionality and quality, while at the same time offering expand-ability. The
  TurtleBot3’s core technology is SLAM, Navigation and Manipulation, making it
  suitable for home service robots. The TurtleBot can run SLAM(simultaneous
  localization and mapping) algorithms to build a map and can drive around the
  environment. Also, it can be controlled remotely from a laptop, joy-pad or
  Android-based smart phone as described in [2]. The TurtleBot can also follow a
  person’s legs as they walk in a room. Our goal is to implement 4 different robotics
  tasks on Turtlebot3 robot, that is based on mainly on knowing how to use ROS to
  manipulate the robot, simulate an environment, Path planning and localization and
  way-points following.
