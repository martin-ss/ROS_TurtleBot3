# ROS_TurtleBot3

## Abstract

* Demonstration of tutlebot3 robot control and simulation is achieved through
  different completed tasks, which in order to be solved, a certain skills related
  to ROS basics in programming and architecture understanding should be
  mastered as described in the initial report, on top of that, Our simulated ROS
  environment provided by The-Construct website is exploited with the
  different provided ROS online courses as well as technical mentoring. As a
  result, our implementation been able to achieve the 4 requested tasks. In this
  report, a detailed guideline about the implementation will be presented in
  order for the reader to be able to implement it him/her self.
